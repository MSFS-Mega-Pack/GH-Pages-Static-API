It is likely that this application will no longer receive any updates, so we recommend you uninstall it.\n\nA huge thanks goes to everyone who has used this livery manager over the past year. It's been a great ride, and we hope you've enjoyed it!\n\nThe entire manager application, API and data sources are [completely public on GitHub](https://github.com/MSFS-Mega-Pack), so feel free to take a peek. Also public are our [A330-300 and A321 projects](https://github.com/Project-Mega-Pack).\n\nKeep in touch by joining [Clink123's public Discord server](https://discord.gg/gsMTu3q).\n\nSee you online,\n\n[David Wheatley](https://davwheat.dev/) and [Jaap Rodenburg](https://github.com/GewoonJaap)\n"
